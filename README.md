# AutoTrader Vehicle Value Prediction

This machine learning project is based on a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader, one of Manchester Metropolitan University's industry partners. The dataset includes anonymized adverts with vehicle information such as make, model, color, mileage, and the selling price. The primary goal was to employ machine learning techniques to develop a regression model for predicting the selling price.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** The dataset comprises anonymized car sale adverts with various vehicle details.
- **Task:** The objective was to leverage machine learning to build a regression model for predicting the selling price.
- **Implementation:** The core machine learning modeling took place in the notebook [AutoTrader Notebook.ipynb]((https://github.com/jamieatiyah/AutoTrader-Vehicle-Value-Prediction/blob/main/AutoTrader%20Notebook.ipynb)).
- **Report:** A concise report, ["AutoTrader Vehicle Value Prediction"](https://github.com/jamieatiyah/AutoTrader-Vehicle-Value-Prediction/blob/main/AutoTrader%20Vehcile%20Value%20Prediction.pdf), provides a summary of key techniques and findings from the project.

## Project Artifacts

- **Notebook:** The implementation details and code for the machine learning models can be found in the notebook [AutoTrader Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/jamieatiyah/AutoTrader-Vehicle-Value-Prediction/blob/main/AutoTrader%20Notebook.ipynb).
- **Report:** A short and structured report, ["AutoTrader Vehicle Value Prediction"](https://github.com/jamieatiyah/AutoTrader-Vehicle-Value-Prediction/blob/main/AutoTrader%20Vehcile%20Value%20Prediction.pdf), highlights key techniques and insights from the project.

## Conclusion

This project aims to predict vehicle selling prices using machine learning techniques applied to the AutoTrader Car Sale Adverts dataset. The accompanying notebook and report provide in-depth insights into the modeling process and key findings.
