# AutoTrader-Vehicle-Value-Prediction

A machine learning project which was based on a Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader, one of the Manchester Metropolitan University's industry partners. The dataset contains anonymised adverts with the information of vehicles such as make, model, colour, mileage, as well as the selling price. The task was to utilise machine learning techniques to produce a regression model for predicting the selling price. The uploaded notebook contains the code used throughout the project. An additional pdf file contains a short report which summarises key techniques and findings from the project.
